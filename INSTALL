Installation
============

Tim is a monolithic Python script. So, when all dependencies are installed,
simply run the script 'src/tim'. For system wide provision, you may copy the
src/tim file to a folder that is in the global $PATH, e.g. to /usr/local/bin/.

Make sure that the file src/tim is marked executable. If not, you may do:
  chmod a+x src/tim

The dependencies of Tim are:
- standard Python libraries (tested with Python 2.7.3):
  - daemon
  - errno
  - math
  - os
  - re
  - shutil
  - signal
  - sys
  - time
- ... nothing else, yet.

Tim has not yet been tested on most operating systems. If you have test
results, bug reports or further installation instructions, please write to:
