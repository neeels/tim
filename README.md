project timer (GUI + cmdline)

You enter project names and start and stop them.
Tim will keep track of how much you worked (and when) and how many of these
worked hours you have already submitted to your money supplier.

git repos started on 2013-01-10, refactoring another older project called
'ptimer' or 'project-timer' (also by me).
