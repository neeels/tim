project timer (GUI + cmdline)

You enter project names and start and stop them.
Tim will keep track of how much you worked (and when) and how many of these
worked hours you have already submitted to your money supplier.

This git repos was started on 2013-01-10, refactoring an older project called
'ptimer' or 'project-timer' (also by me).
Written in Python.

There is no stable release yet.
